<p>
Welcome. So you found this page you might just as well know what's it all about.
</p>
<p><img src="/dfpadsenseoptimiser/img/dog.jpg" /></p>
<p>
I created this website on Github as it is easy to do and provides a simple blogging mechanism that enables me to share and document my experiences.
</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>
I want to find a way how to automatically optimize AdSense adverts. I did this already once in another experiment where I used Google Website Optimizer to multivariate test adverts.<br/>
I simply created multiple variants of AdSense javascript parameters for different layout such as link color, background color, etc.<br/>
Now this time I want to get more professional by using DoubleClick for Publishers Small Business (the free version) as an ad server. I do this because DFP is commonly used within the publishing industry where I work.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So for the next days and weeks I will try to get everything in place and blog about my experience while doing so.
