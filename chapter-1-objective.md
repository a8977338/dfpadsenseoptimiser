## Chapter 1 - Objective

If you are using Google AdSense on your website chances are that you're not making the most of it.
You probably chose the design of your based on how it fitted to your website design or maybe on what
you thought would make your users click more. But are you sure you picked the optimal design with
the best click rate?

You could test multiple designs and track different click rates. But that would be a lot of manual
work and take a lot of time until you get a result.

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-5588356258460519";
/* first_ad */
google_ad_slot = "3376802008";
google_ad_width = 300;
google_ad_height = 250;
googel_test = "on";
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"

</script>

What you need is an automated process that serves your ad designs and tracks them without manual work!

Fortunately Google already provides a tool to do these so called multivariate tests: Google Website
Optimizer.

But GWO is meant to test different layouts for buttons and landing pages and is not at all prepared
for AdSense. In this Tutorial I want to demonstrate a way you can combine the two and eventually get
more money out of your ads but still comply with Googles terms and conditions.
