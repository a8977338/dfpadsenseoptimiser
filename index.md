## Do I really get the most out of my AdSense integration?

You can put a lot of thought into choosing the position and format and style of an AdSense ad unit. Still you probably faced this question more than once. Was the style you chose the most attractive option for your users to click on? Was the position optimal?

You probably based your decisions on how well your ads integrate into your website visually. But how did this effect your AdSense revenue?

Wouldn't it be nice to automatically benchmark different styling options, compare them against each other and then choose the one that performed best in terms of click through rate (CTR)?

That's what I thought so I wrote a book about optimizing AdSense.

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
<h3>Optimizing AdSense - The Book</h3>
<p>In this book I wrote down all the learnings and experiences I gathered while experimenting with Google AdSense, Website Optimizer, Analytics and DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP). Being a developer by heart I went into detail quite a lot.</p>

For those of you who just want to learn what to do and not how it works I also wrote a couple of scenarios for your setup.

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
<h3>Optimizing AdSense - The Scenarios</h3>
<p>In these scenarios I try to provide as least technical as possible informations about how to setup AdSense optimization, what steps are necessary for your experiments and how to conclude.</p>
