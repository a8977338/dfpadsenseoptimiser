## Chapter 2 - Requirements

{{ page.abstract }}

This tutorial can be applied to all websites no matter what technology you use. You probably need to know a bit about javascript but that should be enough.

Other than that you need to have active and working accounts for the Google technologies used in this book.

###### Required

<a name="adsense">&nbsp;</a>
![Google AdSense](/img/google-adsense-logo.gif "Google AdSense logo")

Make sure to have a running Google AdSense account. It should be fully authorized (serving real adverts) already. If you have a premium account (you can not
sign up for this but if you have more than 20 million impressions per month Google will contact you automatically) that will be fine and there will be more
possibilities when optimizing. However a premium account is not necessary.

<a name="analytics">&nbsp;</a>
![Google Analytics](/img/google-analytics-logo.gif "Google Analytics logo")

In order to track the results of your efforts you will need a Google Analytics account. If you already own such an account you can easily set up a new
profile for the page you want to apply this tutorial to.

<a name="optimizer">&nbsp;</a>
![Google Website Optimizer](/img/google-website-optimizer-logo.gif "Google Website Optimizer logo")

Google Website Optimizer is a tool for A/B and Multivariate Testing. It is originally aimed at testing and optimizing landing pages and user interfaces.
This tool is the key ingredient to this tutorial.

###### Optional

<a name="doubleclick">&nbsp;</a>
![DoubleClick For Publishers](/img/doubleclick-for-publishers-logo.png "DoubleClick For Publishers logo")

You can optimize your AdSense implementation with just the above tools. However if you want to act more professionally you might want to consider to use DFP.

When using DoubleClick For Publishers (DFP) there are a few more steps to be taken when optimizing AdSense ads. If you want to run your own ad server on Googles
Platform you may sign up for it. Either contact Google for a full account (your option if you have a high traffic website) or sign up for DFP Small Business for free.
