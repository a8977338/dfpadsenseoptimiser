# Problems setting up DFP

Just after my AdSense account got working I signed up for [DFP Small Business](https://www.google.com/intl/en_US/dfp/info/sb/index.html). I used the same details as in my Adsense account and the form completed successfully.

However I got no email confirmation but a website saying everythings was fine welcoming me to DFP and asking me to login with my AdSense account.

So I did which now leads me to the following error message:

> Unauthorized access
> We apologize for the inconvenience, but you are not authorized to visit this page. If you believe this is an error, please contact your account manager.

My guess is that for some reason Google Apps accounts do not work with DFP but apart from a fast but not helping support email I got no idea what happened. Accoring to the email there is no DFP account created..
