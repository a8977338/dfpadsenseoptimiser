### 2. Create the Maximum Number of Sections

> The maximum number of sections is defined by the maximum number of AdSense ad units on a single page which is *usually three or less* (see also the appropriate entry in the [AdSense FAQ](http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=9735 "Google AdSense FAQ - How many Google ads can I display per page?")).
> For the following a maximum ad unit count of three is assumed.

Apply the following naming scheme to your variations: `optad_[1-3]_style`

You should end up with the following 6 variations:

* **optad_1_style**, style variation of the first ad unit
* **optad_2_style**, style variation of the second ad unit
* **optad_3_style**, style variation of the third ad unit
