### 3. Create the Variations

For *each color section* add as many color scheme variations as you want. You can use the [GWO Duration Calculator](https://www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/siteopt/help/calculator.html "Google Website Optimizer Duration Calculator") to get an idea of how many variations are suitable for you.

Each variation should look like this.

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_color_border = '000000';
google_color_bg     = 'DDDDDD';
google_color_link   = '000080';
google_color_url    = '008000';
google_color_text   = '000000';
//-->
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

You can use the [Google Adsense Generator](http://www.adsense-generator.com/ "Google Adsense Generator") to create some color schemes.

For *each corner section* add up to 11 variations as you want.

Each variation should look like this.

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ui_features = "rc:0";
//-->
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

You can choose any value from `rc:0` (square corners) to `rc:10` (very round corners).
