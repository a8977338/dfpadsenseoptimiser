### 4. Create the Variations

For *each section* add as many style variations as you want. You can use the [GWO Duration Calculator](https://www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/siteopt/help/calculator.html "Google Website Optimizer Duration Calculator") to get an idea of how many variations are suitable for you.

Each variation should look like this.

{% highlight html %}
<style type="text/css">
...
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
