### 3. Pick Combination

In the above screenshot you can see values for *Social Source and Action* that include the following information.

* *name* (i.e. `www.optimizing-adsense.eu`), identifying this project. use this value for your filter if necessary.
* *experiment id* (i.e. `0443911789`), the id of your experiment.
* *combination id* (i.e. `#0004`), representing the combination that was used for this particular case.
* *variation sequence* (i.e. `1,2,0`), tells you which variations were used per section where `0` represents the original (unchanged) variation.

You can now login to your Google Website Optimizer again open the appropriate experiment and pick the appropriate variations.

If the best performing *variation sequence* would be i.e. `1,2,0,1` you would pick the following variations.

* **optad_1_col** => *color variation #1*
* **optad_1_crn** => *corner variation #2*
* **optad_2_col** => *original*
* **optad_2_crn** => *corner variation #1*
